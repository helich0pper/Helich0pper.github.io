## Overview
Enumerate possible user accounts with SMB then poke at LDAP to find a base64 encoded password that sticks out. With those credentials you can login to an SMB user and find a registery
file that contains set of credentials encoded in hex. These credentials will then give us access to a .NET application that we can reverse to find out how password are being decrypted
for a database. This will give us access to Active Directory via remote login which we can "scavenge" the recycle bin and find credentials for an Administrator account.
