# Installing
This installation guide assumes you have all the [dependencies](#dependencies) listed above. <br>

## Linux/BSD
1. ```git clone https://github.com/helich0pper/Karkinos.git```
2. ```cd Karkinos```
3. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. ```cd wordlists && unzip passlist.zip```
You can also unzip it manually using file explorer. Just make sure passlist.txt is in **wordlists** directory.
5. Make sure you have write privileges for ```db/main.db```
6. Enable ```extension=mysqli``` in your php.ini file. <br>
If you don't know where to find this, refer to the PHP <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php#:~:text=d%20php%20PHP%20will%20load,ini%20as%20configuration%20files" target="_blank">docs</a>. <br>
Note: MySQLi is only used to store statistics.
7. Thats it! Now just host it using your preferred web server or run: ```php -S 127.0.0.1:8888``` in the Karkinos directory. <br> <br>
**Important: using port 5555, 5556, or 5557 will conflict with the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/helich0pper/Karkinos/#modules">Modules</a>** <br>
If you insist on using these ports, change the ```PORT``` value in:
- ```/bin/Server/app.py Line 87```
- ```/bin/Busting/app.py Line 155```
- ```/bin/PortScan/app.py Line 128```

## Windows
1. ```git clone https://github.com/helich0pper/Karkinos.git```
2. ```cd Karkinos```
3. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. ```cd wordlists && unzip passlist.zip``` <br>
You can also unzip it manually using file explorer. Just make sure passlist.txt is in **wordlists** directory.
5. ```Make sure you have write privileges for db/main.db```
6. Enable ```extension=mysqli.dll``` in your php.ini file. <br>
If you don't know where to find this, refer to the PHP <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php#:~:text=d%20php%20PHP%20will%20load,ini%20as%20configuration%20files" target="_blank">docs</a>. <br>

# Linux Troubleshooting
<a href="https://twitter.com/helich0pper" target="_blank">Contact me</a> if you are still facing issues. I will frequently update this post if any new bugs/issues are <a href="https://github.com/helich0pper/Karkinos/issues" target="_blank">reported</a>.

#### Statistics not displaying or returning an SQLite error
- Make sure the database exists as ```Karkinos/db/main.db```
- Add ```extension=mysqli``` to the end of your ```php.ini``` file. <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.sqlite3.php" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
- Check your PHP version using ```php --version```. <br> Then install SQLite with ```apt-get install php7.4-sqlite``` (replace "7.4" with your version). <a href="https://www.getastra.com/kb/knowledgebase/how-to-install-sqlite-for-php-on-my-apache-nginx-server/" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
- Restart your web server after any change.


#### Hash cracking not completing
It may take a bit longer for lower-end systems to crack a hash. If you believe it is indeed stuck, try the following:
- Make sure the wordlist is unpacked. Navigate to ```Karkinos/wordlists/``` and unzip ```passlist.zip```.
- Make sure you have write privileges for ```Karkinos/db/main.db```

#### Valid hash is "unknown"
- Make sure the password list you are cracking with has **read** permissions enabled for the web server. <br> Default wordlist location: ```Karkinos/wordlists/passlist.txt```.

#### Modules not starting
- Verify you have Python 3 installed. Run ```apt-get install python3``` in your terminal to install it.
- Verify the commands in ```Karkinos/includes/pid.php``` are in your systems PATH.
- Install the requirements in the ```Karkinos/requirements.txt``` file.<br> Use: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```.
